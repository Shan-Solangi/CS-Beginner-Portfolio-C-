C++

My first project was developed during my first semesters as part of my Computer Science degree. As I progress in my studies, I will be uploading more projects. Continuous learning and improvement are key to my journey, and I welcome constructive feedback to help identify any mistakes and areas where I can enhance my skills.

Hospital Management System
This is my first project, created during my 1st semester of my Computer Science degree. The project is a Student Management System developed in C++. The system allows you to:

Add, view, and delete patient records.
Add, view, and delete patient diagnosis records.
View full History of the Patient.

Records are saved permanently using file handling (read/write).
Features:
Hospital Management System : You can manage both patient and diagnosis report by performing actions like adding, viewing, and deleting their records.
Permanent Data Storage: All records are saved using file handling, ensuring the data persists even after the program is closed.

Technical Details:
Language: C++
Concepts Used:
Simple loops
Arrays
Structures
File handling (reading and writing data)
If-else conditions
This project helped me grasp foundational concepts in programming, and it was a great introduction to working with files and handling data in C++.
